A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

A simple social media page with the nescessarry fucntions for this delivery, and whatever else I bothered looking into. The benefits of my page is

- Quick and clean
- Only 3 pages, so most loads are done in js, instead of needing page refresh
- Users own profile page makes it easy to edit, but still see it the same way as onlookers
- you can either search by search text, or sort by tag
- A disadventage in it's current state is that I only loads last 100 posts, but hides many of the incomplete/test ones, so will only get a varying amount of posts, depending on how much crap posts are placed. I know I could make multiple api calls until I reach 100 anyways.
